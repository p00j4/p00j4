### Hi there 👋
I'm Pooja, an automation nerd and open source enthusiast. I love brainstorming and implementing crazy ideas to figure out ways to improve the product quality. Having a blend of dev, qa & devops mindset, I strives to bridge the gaps between all the teams to attain the best results.
Driven by curiosity to learn & share new things every day, I pen them, open-source, record tutorials and talk about them at open conferences, some of the glimpses can be found here:

- **I'm most excited** about: [Alice | Shield](https://github.com/p00j4/alice) - A bot which solves Human [Communication Problems](https://p00j4.github.io/#alice), and shields from buggy code by enabling **Continuos Integration** safety pipeline.
